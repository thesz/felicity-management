# General description

An attempt to create good software builds management "thing" (for I have no better word here) that helps with attaining goals faster and more precisely.

Typical software management works with packages just like legislatures of most of governments. Just like with legislatures, packages can bring unneeded or unwanted features into build and maintenance process.

Oftentimes one does not need a package but a concrete feature of that package, be it concrete program behavior or implementation of a concrete function. The isolation of that is one of goals of **felicity**.

One also would like to inspect and inform oneself with the inner workings of different parts of the system under investigation and most current systems are not all that good in that respect. For example, REPLs often do not work for modules that are not in current package, etc. This must be changed.

# What's in the name

**Felicity** is not only an "intense happiness" but also "the ability to find exact expression for one's thoughts".

I guess it is apt name for good software management system that avoids tying users into secretive clique and is not overly industralized. Puns and punches are well intended.
